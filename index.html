    <h2> Why Pizza?</h2>
  <div>
      <p>Everyone likes pizza.  There's nothing like a fresh, warm slice of za to bring the day next level.  It's also versatile.  Think about it.  You want a taco on your pizza?  Done.  You want a salad on your pizza?  No problem.  You want a literal inch of cheese and filling in your deep dish slice so that you can barely breathe afterward?  We've got you. <br><br>
      Pizza played a big role in my childhood.  My pizza roots start with the infamous Hot n Ready, and, no, I'm not ashamed to admit it.  There's a time and place for a good Hot n Ready.  And, for me, that time and place was the early 2000s in Muskegon, Michigan. Some of you may remember a time when the Hot n Ready was only one day per week.  I looked forward to each and every Monday when I could sink my teeth into a blend of cardboard crust and rubbery cheese.  Also, how have they not raised their prices in twenty years?  Let's discuss over lunch.  Pizza, anyone?

    <h2> What Makes a Good Pie </h2>
  <div class="good_pizza">
    <br>There are a lot of variables that go into making a solid slice.  Here are my top qualites, in no particular order:<br>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Crust</strong> - You've gotta start with a good base.  Any good pizza chef will know what style they're going for: deep dish, thin crust, wood fired, etc. and then perfect it.</li>
          <li><strong>Sauce</strong> - The next layer is key.  Whether it's pesto, a regular red, or no sauce at all, this is your canvas for the rest of the masterpiece.  Flavor is key, but it needs to be subtle enough to not take away from the rest of what's happening.</li>
          <li><strong>Cheese</strong> - If there's something I love more than pizza, it's cheese. Ide ally, there will be just the right amount so you get that gorgeous mouth to pizza string of melted cheese as you pull away your first bite.  There is nothing more perfect in life.</li>
          <li><strong>Toppings</strong> - If you're a Kevin McAlister and are a classic cheese person, that's fine.  I guess.  But the toppings are where you can get really next level with your pie.  Creativity is key here, introducing your taste buds to new possibilities: think walnuts, brocolli, goat cheese, kale.  Trust me.</li>
        </ol>
        As you can see, I actually just listed all the components of pizza.  Because they're all.so.good.

    <h2>Best Za in Denver</h2>

    <!-- <div class="best_za">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Budget Slice</strong> - <a href = "https://www.marquispizza.com/" target="_blank">Marquis Pizza</a> - If you're looking for a classic slice of New York pizza, this greasy goddess will deliver. <br><br>
        <li><strong>Mid-range</strong> - <a href = "https://bluepandenver.com/" target="_blank">Blue Pan</a> -  Detroit style pizza is making its way west.  Maybe I'm biased because it's the closest thing to those crunchy corner pieces we Michiganders know and love, but I think Blue Pan would hold up against the best pizzarias in the Motor City.<br><br>
        <li><strong>Splurge</strong> - <a href ="https://cart-driver.com/" target="_blank">Cart Driver</a> -  With a seasonal menu, this place is always cookin' up something tasty and fresh.  Their artisan, wood-fired style pizzas are worth the typical line and throwing elbows for a table.<br>
